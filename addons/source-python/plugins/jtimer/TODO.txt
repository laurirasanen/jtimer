	- loading bonus data
		> bonus id
		> start zone
		> end zone

	- loading checkpoint data
		> checkpoint id
		> which map, course, bonus ids does checkpoint apply to?
		> this allows us to share a checkpoint zone between map, course and bonus runs!
		> ordering of checkpoints might be confusing this way however, on maps where
		> for example course 2 is just the map backwards.
		> have checkpoint id references in map/course/bonus data instead of the other way around?
		> if map has courses, should all checkpoints be in the course segments and not in map?
